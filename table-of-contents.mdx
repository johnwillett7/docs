[Rogo](https://tryrogo.com/) is an AI-powered research platform for professionals at hedge funds, investment banks, private equity firms, financial research firms, and consulting firms. It saves you time accessing and analyzing your most important information.

Existing generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) are not a good fit for finance. They don’t have access to the requisite data, and they often provide wrong answers. Even when they provide the right answers, they don’t provide the sources necessary to verify the information.

Rogo allows you to quickly & seamlessly search through all of your most important data: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, market data, broker research, alternative data, investor presentations, web & news, etc. And it meticulously provides direct links to sources for every answer it gives. 

This onboarding document only discusses the data sources in our public, off-the-shelf product. When we partner with your firm, we’ll connect all the data you actually work with every day (broker research, investor presentations, etc.).

Rogo was built by ex-investment bankers and hedge professionals. It is backed by some of the world’s leaders in finance, data, and AI, including the founders of Business Insider, Amazon Alexa, and MongoDB.
