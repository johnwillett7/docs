In terms of data the options are:

1. All external data – our off-the-shelf version, with no adjustments
2. All external data – bespoke deployment with your firm: custom data integrations, branded exports, etc.
3. External and internal data – includes firm proprietary materials (PowerPoints, PDFs, Excels, etc.)

<Accordion title="How can Rogo be customized for my firm?">
This onboarding document only discusses the data sources in our public, off-the-shelf product. When we partner with your firm, we’ll connect all the data you actually work with every day:

- Broker research
- Market data (FactSet, etc.)
- Alternative data
– Personalzied news feeds

And that’s just external data. We also connect firms’ proprietary internal data – PowerPoints, PDFs, etc.

Beyond data sources, we also offer customized:

- Branded PowerPoint / Excel exports
- Exports to workflow tools (Slack, Teams, Outlook, etc.)
- Auth & permissioning
- Deployments in your technical infrastructure
