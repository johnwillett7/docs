## 🤖 Overview
This is really Rogo’s bread and butter. Whether you’re an intern, analyst, associate, PM, MD, partner, or any other role, it’s common to spend hours every day extracting the numbers you need from filings, transcripts, presentations, research, and more. Rogo automates that labor-intensive work. And the best part is: It always provides a link directly to a highlighted section of the materials. You can use that to verify all of the numbers, and even send it to your team or put in your Excel cell comments so they can do the same.

## 📞 Pull non-GAAP metrics from earnings (Earnings)
Metrics like revenue and net profit are usually easy to find in a company’s SEC filings financial statements. Non-GAAP metrics like organic sales, retention, dollar expansion, net adds, etc.? Not so much. Getting these numbers is often a painstaking process of looking across various earnings calls and more. Rogo lets you do this in seconds.
