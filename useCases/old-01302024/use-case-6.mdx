## 🤖 Overview
Getting high-quality information on acquisitions can be incredibly time-intensive. Rogo makes it easy.

## 📞 Ask how a company is talking about an acquisition in its earnings (Earnings)
Some of the best color on deals comes through in earnings calls – companies reveal their rationale for their own deals as well as their attitudes towards the broader M&A landscape.

## 📂 Drill into how an acquisition is affecting a company’s filings (SEC Filings)
Big acquisitions have complicated impacts on a company’s balance sheet. Teasing out those impacts can be a headache. Use Rogo to dig through filings and see exactly where a deal is flowing through line items.

## 🌐 Stay on top of recent deals (Web)
This particular use case is a decent way to get up to speed on deals & get talking points before a call, but it’s not Rogo’s strong suit, and it’s possible for Rogo to miss key deals. Make sure to verify information for yourself.
