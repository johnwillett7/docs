## 🤖 Overview
With Rogo, you have millions of financial documents at your fingertips. And Rogo is amazing at summarizing & synthesizing this information for you, dissecting many documents at once to give you only the information you need to know. Check out some of these use cases.

## 📞 Summarize a transcript (Earnings)
Here’s the most basic one – if you want a summary of a document like an earnings transcript, just ask for it!
