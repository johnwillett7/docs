## 🤖 Overview
One of Rogo’s best use cases is keeping you up to date on news events from around the world. It’s like a personal intern you can ask to read a ton of news briefings and answer any question on any topic related to current (or historical) events – always providing sources. Here are some examples.

## 1️⃣ Get digestible updates on a specific story (Web)
For any news topic imaginable (seriously), just ask Rogo for a few concise bullet points summarizing what’s happening.

## 2️⃣ Get balanced viewpoints for a topic (Web)
In an increasingly polarized world, Rogo makes it easy to make sure you’re getting a variety of perspectives. It can go out and find the best news sources arguing either sides of any issue (no matter the issue).
