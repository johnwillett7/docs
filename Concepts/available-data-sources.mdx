## 2️⃣ Web
Rogo can surf the web for you and aggregate information with sources. All you do is give it a command into the search bar.

<AccordionGroup>

	<Accordion title="Writing a search">
		Say you’re researching the market penetration of some gig economy companies in different geographies. All you have to do is ask Rogo: ***“make a table of doordash's market share across new york, san francisco, LA, and boston.”***

	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="Looking at sources">
		Every piece of information Rogo returns always has a link to the source it got it from. To verify information for yourself and decide if it’s trustworthy, just click on the footnote.

	</Accordion>

	<Accordion title="Writing a follow-up">
		You can always follow up on a Rogo query. Here we just ask Rogo to add a year column to the table. We find out the San Francisco data is from 2021, not 2023.

	<Accordion title="Pulling numbers from filings">
		You spread metrics from filings the same way you do for transcripts. Here we search: ***”make a table of nvidia's fiscal 2022 revenue across the us, china, and taiwan.”*** Then we click on the source to find the relevant section of the filing.
