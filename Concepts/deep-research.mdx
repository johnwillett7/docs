## 🤖 Overview
Rogo’s normal Chat is excellent even for relatively nuanced research questions requiring multiple sources, a deep understanding of financial analysis, and synthesis of a lot of text data. But sometimes your questions are too nuanced and layered for Rogo’s normal search & chat features to handle. In those cases, turn to “Deep Research.”

In Deep Research, Rogo uses planning capabilities to be an autonomous research analyst on your behalf. You can give it the sort of tasks you’d give to your analysts and expect them to spend the full day on.

The downside? It takes a while, sometimes up to 30 minutes. But used well, it can save you more time than perhaps anything else in the product.

## ❓When Should You Use this Feature?
The short answer is any time answering your question requires multiple steps.

In a normal search, Rogo uses your question to go out and choose sources. Then it uses those sources to answer your question. That works great most of the time. But sometimes finding the right sources requires more trial and error. Sometimes you need to look at one set of sources to figure out what the real set of sources should be.

A good example is anytime you’re asking Rogo to find a certain data point for a list of things satisfying some condition, where it’s not immediately easy which things and which things won’t. For instance, below we ask Rogo to find revenue and number of stores opened for Starbucks and McDonald’s in the cities where Starbucks has opened the most stores recently. In normal search, this wouldn’t work, because Rogo first needs to find the right cities and then find the relevant metrics for those cities.
