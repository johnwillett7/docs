## ü§ñ Overview
One of the main reasons about Rogo is its sources. For every piece of information in its responses, Rogo gives you the source it uses to get that answer, along with a footnote. Rogo is not (yet) a tool that decides whether sources are trustworthy. It leaves that job to you. Luckily, it makes it easy.

## ‚úÖ The Rogo Results Page
Rogo‚Äôs results give you all the tools you need to verify every piece of information for yourself.

## üîç Looking at Filings or Transcripts Sources
On filings or transcripts, just click on the source on the right side to go straight to the highlighted portion of the document where the information is pulled from.

#### A couple of important points:
1. First, make sure to wait until the full response is done generating to do this. The highlighting is done after the response is finished generating.
2. Second, make sure to click on the actual Source on the right like the video below, rather than on the footnotes. The footnotes in the text response download a PDF of the document for you, so use those if that‚Äôs your goal.

## üîç Looking at Web Sources
On web, you can either click on the Source on the right or click on the footnote associated with a piece of information to check its source.

With web sources, all Rogo can do is take you straight to the URL of the website it is referencing ‚Äì it can‚Äôt take you to the relevant section of the webpage and highlight.
