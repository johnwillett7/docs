## 🤖 Overview
Rogo has over 15.6 million financial documents in its corpus. File search is the simplest way to search through this data. Just input a keyword or key phrase, optionally input a company ticker, and let AI search find all the matches.

## ⏰ When should I use File Search instead of Chat?
File Search has two main advantages over Chat:
1. It’s much faster
2. You know you’re getting *all* relevant results – if you search “GPUs” over Microsoft’s documents, Rogo will definitely return every single match. Chat doesn’t carry this same guarantee.

It also has disadvantages:
1. It does not generate a reply – no synthesis, no analysis, no aggregation, nothing. It just hands you the matches back and lets you do with them what you will.
2. Its intuition abilities are less powerful. In the Microsoft GPUs example, File Search may not return thematic matches to topics related to GPUs, whereas Chat will.
3. It cannot access the web.
