## 🤖 Overview
No one works in a silo, especially in finance. Just as important as getting sources for your answers is being able to share those sources with others. In this section we learn how to create links to highlighted portions of documents in Rogo that you can put in your Excel cell comments or send to your peers. (Good news – it’s insanely easy.)

## ⛓️ Link to existing Rogo sources
Your first option is just to take an existing source in a Rogo answer that is highlighting a section you’re interested in and copy the URL.

## ⛓️ Link to a new piece of text
Your second option is to highlight a new piece of text from a filing or transcript you’re looking at and press “Copy Link.” Here we’re showing that on File Search since that is more common (imagine you’re spreading comps, or pulling income statement numbers, and need links to put in to your Excel cell comments), but this works anytime you’re looking at a file in Rogo.
