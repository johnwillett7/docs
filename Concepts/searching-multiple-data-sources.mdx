## 🤖 Overview
Rogo lets you search on multiple data sources at once. Here’s how:

## 💽 Selecting Multiple Data Sources
<video
	controls
	className="w-full aspect-video"
	src="/video/select-multiple-data-sources.mp4"
></video>

## ❓When Should You Do This?
If you have a good sense of what data source is best for your answer (earnings vs. filings vs. web, etc.), you’re typically going to get better answers by just going on that source. Use this feature when:
1. You are searching for a number / an answer but you don’t know where it is; or
2. You are preparing a report, deck, or any other sort of response that requires the synthesis of multiple sources.
