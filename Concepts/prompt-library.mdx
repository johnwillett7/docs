## ü§ñ Overview
Rogo‚Äôs prompt library is your best friend as you get to know the platform ‚Äì and even after that. It‚Äôs a list of template searches for Chat that work well.

Just like with ChatGPT, how you ‚Äúprompt‚Äù Rogo impacts the helpfulness of results. Asking for specific details, specifying results formats, specifying tone & context‚Ä¶ all of this matters. The prompt library is a way to have a toolkit of reliable formats for high quality output. And it makes it super easy to get started in Rogo. All you have to do is fill in the gaps with the companies, topics, or requests you‚Äôre interested in.

**See below how to use Rogo‚Äôs existing prompt library ‚Äì and also how to add your own new prompts.**

## üìö How to Use Our Prompt Library
Once you open our prompt library menu, just click on the prompt you are interested in. It will then populate in search.

Two things to note here:
1. Prompts have specific data sources associated with them. Regardless of which data sources you had selected in search before, once you a click a prompt, its data sources will become the ones selected.
2. Make sure to click on the [bracketed words] to edit them to fit your intended question.

Some tricks here for making good prompts:

1. **Be specific about which sources you want Rogo to use.** If you want to use recent filings, transcripts, or news sources say that.
2. **Be specific about the output format you would like.** If you want a bullet point report, a table, or a memo, say that.
3. **Some tactical advice:** Reminding Rogo to ‚Äúformat its results cleanly using markdown‚Äù is often a quick hack to get cleaner output.
