## 🤖 Overview
It doesn’t take much practice to use Rogo. If you’ve ever used ChatGPT, or even Google search, you’re already in great shape. This section goes over how to write a search in Chat, but make sure to check out the Use Cases section of these pages for a ton of example questions you can ask.

## 💽 Selecting a data source
Every search you write in Rogo has one or more data sources that Rogo is going to use to answer your question. Choosing a source is easy – just click on the magnifying glass (🔍) near search and then select an option.

## 🔤 Writing Your First Search
After selecting your data source in Rogo, just type in natural language what you want Rogo to do. Here we ask it to: _“summarize AMD's most recent earnings transcript, especially pulling out key numbers related to gaming center revenue.”_
