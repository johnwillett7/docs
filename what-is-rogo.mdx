## üìö Background
[Rogo](https://www.tryrogo.com/) is an AI-powered research platform for professionals at hedge funds, investment banks, private equity firms, financial research firms, and consulting firms. It saves you time accessing and analyzing your most important information.

Existing generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) are not a good fit for finance. They don‚Äôt have access to the requisite data, and they often provide wrong answers. Even when they provide the right answers, they don‚Äôt provide the sources necessary to verify the information.

Rogo allows you to quickly & seamlessly search through all of your most important data: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, market data, alternative data, web & news, etc. And it meticulously provides direct links to sources for every answer it gives.

## ü§ù Working With Rogo
This onboarding document only discusses the data sources in our public, off-the-shelf product. When we partner with your firm, we‚Äôll connect all the data you actually work with every day (broker research, investor presentations, etc.).

## ü™™ Who We Are
Rogo was built by ex-investment bankers and hedge professionals. It is backed by some of the world‚Äôs leaders in finance, data, and AI, including the founders of Business Insider, Amazon Alexa, and MongoDB.

## üîç Important Note
We need your help! These are the early, wild-west days of this technology, and you know your use cases better than we do. Give us feedback on what's working, what isn't, and what would be helpful.
